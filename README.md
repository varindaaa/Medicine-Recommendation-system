🩺 HealthPredict: Disease Prediction and Medicine Recommendation System

📺 Project Overview
HealthPredict is an interactive web application that predicts diseases based on user-entered symptoms and provides personalized recommendations including medications, diet plans, and precautions.
The project covers the complete workflow from data preprocessing and machine learning model training to building a Flask-based web interface for real-time predictions.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python – For data preprocessing, model development, and backend implementation
Flask – To create the web application backend
Scikit-learn – For training and evaluating machine learning models
Pandas & NumPy – For data manipulation and preprocessing
Pickle – For deploying the trained model
HTML, CSS & Bootstrap – For building an interactive and responsive frontend

📊 Key Features

Disease Prediction: Predicts potential diseases based on user-inputted symptoms using multiple ML classifiers
Multiple ML Models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Multinomial Naive Bayes with hyperparameter optimization
Recommendation System: Provides disease descriptions, medication suggestions, diet plans, and precautionary measures
Interactive Web Interface: Easy-to-use frontend for real-time symptom input and result visualization
Real-time Predictions: Model deployed using Pickle to provide instant predictions

📷 Application Interface
The web application offers a simple and responsive UI, allowing users to enter symptoms and instantly receive disease predictions along with detailed recommendations.
